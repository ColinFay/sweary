Sweary is an R package that contains a database of swear words from different languages, cherry picked by native speakers.

# Origin

The idea first appeared after the [South Park text analysis lightning talk](https://github.com/pdrhlik/southparktalk-whyr2018) at the [Why R? 2018 conference](http://whyr2018.pl/) in Wroc≈Çaw. All the contributors will be acknowledged as the work progresses.
