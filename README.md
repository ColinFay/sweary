Sweary is an R package that contains a database of swear words from different languages, cherry picked by native speakers.

```

## Current swear word lists

| Language      | Language code | Number of swear words |

## How to use it

The package contains a data frame called `swear_words`. You can filter or modify it as you wish now. There will be convenient functions to extract only the languages that are of your interest.

## Contributions

You are welcome to create a pull request either with modifications to current lists or with a completely new language.

## Origin

The idea first appeared after the [South Park text analysis lightning talk](https://github.com/pdrhlik/southparktalk-whyr2018) at the [Why R? 2018 conference](http://whyr2018.pl/) in Wroc≈Çaw. All the contributors will be acknowledged as the work progresses.
